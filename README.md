# LLM-finetuning

I've watched many videos on fine-tuning LLMs this week, but these three stood out the most. If you have time for just one, watch the first one—it covers everything you need to know about fine-tuning and merging models.

► Video 1: Everything You Need to Know About Fine-tuning and Merging LLMs – A deep dive into fine-tuning techniques like LoRA, QLoRA, PPO, and DPO, presented by Maxime Labonne. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLrOI65XbDw

► Video 2: LoRA & QLoRA Fine-tuning Explained In-Depth – A detailed breakdown of LoRA vs. full-parameter fine-tuning and key hyperparameters.
